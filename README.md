# Dark/Light Mode

Description:
The Dark/Light Mode Switcher project is a dynamic and user-friendly web application built with React and powered by the Context API. This project offers users the ability to customize their website experience by toggling between two visually appealing themes: dark mode and light mode. It's designed to enhance user experience and accessibility by catering to various preferences and environments.

## Key Features:

- Dark and Light Modes: Users can easily switch between dark and light modes with a simple toggle button, which changes the entire color scheme and appearance of the website.

- Context API Integration: The project leverages the React Context API to manage and distribute the global state related to the chosen theme throughout the entire application. This ensures consistent theming across components without prop drilling.


The Dark/Light Mode Switcher project showcases the power of React and the Context API for managing global state in a simple yet impactful way. By offering a dynamic theming option, it enhances user experience and allows for greater personalization while maintaining a visually appealing and accessible design. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate a similar feature into your website or a user who prefers customization, this project serves as an excellent example of how to create a seamless dark/light mode experience.
